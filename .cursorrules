# Payslip App Development Rules

## Architecture & Code Quality
- Maintain clear separation of concerns:
  - `app/` - Screens (expo-router)
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components
  - `context/` - State management (ThemeContext, etc.)
  - `constants/` - Theme colors, config values
  - `types/` - TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `data/` - Mock data and data fetching
  - `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- Use idiomatic React Native and TypeScript patterns
- Keep components small, focused, and reusable
- Avoid code duplication - extract shared logic
- Use meaningful naming conventions

## Type Safety & Tooling
- Define proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Type navigation params explicitly
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` or proper types instead
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Export types from `types/index.ts`

## Native Handling & Platform Awareness
- Use expo-file-system for file operations
- Handle Android runtime permissions properly
- Provide clear user feedback (success/error toasts)
- Handle platform differences (iOS vs Android) gracefully
- Use expo-sharing for share functionality

## UX, Accessibility & Polish
- Maintain consistent visual hierarchy
- Support dark/light mode throughout
- Use proper accessibility labels
- Ensure intuitive navigation flow
- Provide loading states and empty states

## Stability & Error Handling
- Wrap async operations in try/catch
- Handle permission denied scenarios
- Handle file write/read failures gracefully
- Avoid unhandled promise rejections
- No console.log in production code (use proper logging)

## Testing
- Write meaningful unit tests for utilities
- Test basic UI behavior
- Focus on testing business logic
- Keep tests readable and focused

## Documentation
- Keep README up-to-date with setup instructions
- Document architecture decisions
- Note any trade-offs made
- List known limitations and future improvements
